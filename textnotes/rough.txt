Here's the guidance you need:
Concept: Dynamic class instance retrieval
Goal: Design a system to retrieve all instances of a class dynamically using the class name
Key ideas:
Dynamic class identification: Identify the class from the user input (e.g., "User")
Instance storage: Store instances of each class in a data structure (e.g., dictionary or list)
Class-level method: Define a class-level method (.all()) to retrieve all instances of the class
Instance retrieval: Retrieve all instances of the identified class from the storage
Return instances: Return a list of retrieved instances
Considerations:
How to store instances of each class
How to identify the class from the user input
How to define a class-level method to retrieve instances
How to retrieve instances from the storage
How to format the returned instances
Hint: Use a dictionary or other data structure to store instances of each class, and consider using Python's globals() function to access the class definition from the class name.


Let's say you have a class called "Car" and you want to retrieve all instances of this class. You can define a class-level method called "all()" that returns a list of all instances of the class.
Here's an example:
class Car:
    instances = []

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Car.instances.append(self)

    @classmethod
    def all(cls):
        return cls.instances

# Create some instances of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota")
car2 = Car("Honda")
car3 = Car("Ford")

# Retrieve all instances of the Car class
all_cars = Car.all()

# Print the names of all cars
for car in all_cars:
    print(car.name)
In this example, the "all()" method returns a list of all instances of the Car class. You can then iterate over this list to access each instance and its attributes.
Note that this is a simplified example and you may need to adapt it to your specific use case.
