That sounds like a great plan! Here's a summary of your next steps based on our conversation:

1. **Base Class (Optional):**
   - If your data structures (listings, users, etc.) are simple for now, you might not need a separate base class initially.
   - However, consider creating a base class if you anticipate your data model becoming more complex in the future. This can help with code organization and inheritance for shared attributes/methods across data types.
2. **Console with Command Design Pattern:**
   - Focus on implementing the Console component with the Command Design Pattern.
   - Define separate command classes for each user action (add listing, view listings, etc.).
   - Each command class should handle parsing arguments, interacting with the Data class (if needed), and delegating storage operations to the Storage Engine.
3. **Storage Engine (JSON):**
   - Implement the Storage Engine component to handle reading/writing data from/to the JSON file.
   - Use the json library in Python for data serialization and deserialization.
4. **Research and Development:**
   - As you progress, refer back to your project requirements to ensure you're building the functionalities needed.
   - Conduct further research on specific aspects like data structures, command class design, and error handling based on your needs.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic set of functionalities and gradually extend them as you gain confidence.
- **Modular Code:** Break down your code into well-defined functions and classes for better maintainability.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify that each component (commands, storage engine) functions as expected.

By following these steps and conducting ongoing research, you'll be well on your way to building a robust and functional console application for your Airbnb clone project!
